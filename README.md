A lot of times political polls are trying to understand fairly concrete things: How many Americans support the President? Who will win the next election? But some of the things that most interest political scientists are things that are a little harder to get a handle on, but putting them into numbers is still pretty important. Why is it that some countries seem to be better able to hand over power from one party to the other without it breaking out into a war? Why is it considered more acceptable in some areas to openly criticise leaders and less so in others? And why are some communities better able than others at organizing themselves and finding political solutions to their problems? These get to some of the core of politics - beliefs that people have not about a particular candidate or issue, but about they things work generally in their community in general.

It's this last thing, a quality Robert Putnam calls 'social capital' that I think is particularly important. And until recently, we didn't have great tools to measure it.

But first, why is it important at all and why would we need to measure it?
These things are hard to get at, but they're really important - and not just for purely academic purposes. Take the last example: how able communities are to work together to resolve their problems, or at least organize to petition their government for a solution. Robert Putnam, best know for his book [_Bowling Alone_](http://bowlingalone.com/), has spent the better part of his career describing this topic, what he calls 'social capital.' Social capital is a quality of a community that describes a set of interconnected social networks, beliefs about trustworthiness and the idea that of one person pitches in today, someone else will help them later down the road. Communities with higher social capital aren't necessarily happier or wealthier, but they're better able to take what's making them unhappy and solve the problem with the tools available. These are communities where people see themselves as neighbors, not just residents. They look out for each other and pitch in when they know someone is in need.
You might never know by walking through one of these communities that this was the case, but the lives of its citizens are undoubtedly better for it.

But maybe you could walk through this neighborhood and have a sense that something 'feels' better about it. Being able to attach a number to that feeling is important. If, as research has shown, communities with lower social capital are less resilient and have less power to represent their greivances in a public forum, these are precisely the communities that need the most help from public resources in ordinary times - and may need extra help in times of true crisis. Because the people who administer public policy need metrics, things that don't get measured don't necessarily get taken into consideration.

Robert Putnam and others working in the field tended to measure this with surveys, but those are expensive, and the ones that get done either cover very small areas or have too few responses in any given area to really get a feel for how one community might be different from another one. But there is at least one organization in the US that surveys a lot of people. Technically, they try to talk to everybody. Because the Constitution says they have to.

So where's the data?
Because the US Census Bureau has such a massive job to do every ten years, they do a lot of planning. And one of the things they plan for is how hard it's going to be to track people down in your neighborhoos. The harder it is, the more people they need to hire to knock on your door. The Census Bureau needs to know this to staff their own data collection.

But in measuring this they're also picking up on something else. If you think about it, responding to the census, or any survey, is really a small donation of your time - or a tax if you're feeling less charitable. But there's a lot of research showing that people who are more likely to volunteer for surveys are also more likely to volunteer for a lot of other stuff. They're people who are more prone to giving up their own effort for others. If you ignore your census form in the mail, they'll send someone to knock on your door eventually - but we suspected that people who respond quickly to the census are more likely to do all kinds of other good community-oriented things, and place where there are a lot of them should measure higher in social capital. In short, we thought the Census is unwittingly mapping the community spirit of every block in America.

<p>Our analysis seems to bear this out. We compared census response rates to a variety of surveys, including deep-dive polls that pulled from large samples of individual communities around the country, as well as a large-scale survey of neighborhoods throughout Chicago. We consistently found that census response rates were hogh in communities where people reported being more likely to interact with their neighbors, cooperate with their neighbors to solve common problems and believe that they could have a positive imapct in bettering their community. Even controlling for things we thought could be driving this result -- income, family structure, racial and ethnic makup or age distribution -- we found that communities with higher census response rates were more socially and civically engaged. In short, in carrying out its ordinary Constitutional duty, the Census is unwittingly mapping the community spirit of every block in America.
