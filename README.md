Most of the time political polls are trying to understand fairly concrete things: How many Americans support the President? Who will win the next election? But often what most interests political scientists are things that are a little harder to measure with just a single question, but just as important to put a number to. We more or less know a democracy when we see one, but how would go about saying this democracy is an eight and that one is a four? A lot rides on these kinds of distinctions: which countries do policy makers decide to negotiate with or share resources, and which to put more at arms' length. A little closer to home, we know that some communities just seem to work better and have neighbors that look out for each other. Some neighborhoods have so many things going against them that the case is obvious that they are worse off than others, but it can sometime be difficult to measure this intangible feeling with the normal data we tend to have at hand, and sometimes there just simply isn't enough reliable data to be useful for the purposes we have in mind.

This latter concept is a quality Robert Putnam calls 'social capital.' He argues, and many social scientists agree, it forms the bedrock of what makes communities successful. But until recently there weren't very good tools to measure it. My colleague Ben Newman and I have managed to find some buried treasure in the day-to-day record-keeping of the US census that suggests a solution.

Robert Putnam, best know for his book [_Bowling Alone_](http://bowlingalone.com/), has spent the better part of his career documenting the importance of social capital. In broad terms, social capital is a quality of a community that describes a set of interconnected social networks among neighborhoods, a prevailing belief that neighbors can be trusted and that if one person pitches in to help out another today, they'll be helped out in turn sometime down the road. Communities with relatively high levels of social capital aren't necessarily wealthier, though concentrated poverty and associated problems obviously make this ideal harder to reach.

Perhaps a person passing through a neighborhood like this could have a sense that something 'feels' better about the area but not be able to place their finger on it. But the stakes of attaching a number to that feeling are high. If, as research has shown, communities with lower social capital are less resilient and are less empowered to be heard in a public forum, these are precisely the communities that need the most help from public resources in ordinary times - and may need extra help in times of true crisis. Because the people who administer public policy need metrics to make these decisions, its key to measure everything that matters.

The problem is that good measurement can be extraordinarily expensive.
Putnam and others working in the field have measured social capital with surveys, but any given survey is rarely carried out with enough depth to represent a given community with enough granularity to make comparisons that are any better than the economic, demographic or crime statistics that are already being collected. But there is at least one organization in the US that has the budget to survey an enormous amount of people. And while the framers of the Constitution didn't have the well-being of American communities in mind when they mandated the decennial census, in the course of their ordinary work modern census takers leave a trail behind them that lets us do precisely that.

Because the US Census Bureau has such a massive job to do every ten years, they do a lot of planning. One of the things they want to make sure they get right is how hard it's going to be to track people down. The law says they have to count everyone. If they can count on you to return your census form yourself, that's another door they don't have to hire someone to knock on. They know, down to the household, who on your block turned in their form last time, and they know that for pretty much every neighborhood in the country.

This specific behavior -- turning in a census form early -- actually tells us a lot about a person, and a community, beyond how easy it is to count them. If you think about it, responding to any survey is really a small donation of your time. There's a lot of research showing that people who are more likely to volunteer for surveys are also more likely to volunteer for a lot of other things, giving their time to the community at large. Maybe these are people who value their time less, but maybe on average they are a little more likely to expect that someone else would do the same for them. Maybe by asking a small favor of someone from every household in the country, the census bureau is engaging in an enormous social experiment.

Our analysis seems to bear out this basic idea. We compared census response rates to a variety of surveys, including deep-dive polls that pulled from large samples of individual communities around the country, as well as a large-scale survey of neighborhoods throughout Chicago. We consistently found that census response rates were high in communities where people reported being more likely to interact with their neighbors, cooperate with their neighbors to solve common problems and believe that they could have a positive imapct in bettering their community. Even controlling for things we thought could be driving this result, things like income, family structure, racial and ethnic makup or age distribution, we found that communities with higher census response rates were more socially and civically engaged. In short, in carrying out its day-to-day work, the Census may unwittingly be mapping the cohesion of every neighborhood in America.
